# Prompt Archive ‚Äî List CRUD

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Feature:** 04-list-crud  
**JIRA:** MOOD-4

---

# üß© CONTEXT

This project illustrates a **Prompt-Driven Development** approach.
Each feature must produce:
- **clear and executable code** (Swift 6, SwiftUI),
- **concise pedagogical documentation**,
- and a **complete prompt archive** for traceability and sharing.

---

# üéØ OBJECTIVE

Implement the complete CRUD list of moods with SwiftData persistence using MVVM pattern.

Demonstrate:
- Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- SwiftData with @Query for reactive data
- MVVM architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Form validation and error handling
- Sheet presentation for add/edit operations
- Swipe actions and tap gestures

---

# üß± FILES TO CREATE OR MODIFY

1. **MoodBoard/Sources/ViewModels/CRUDViewModel.swift** - Business logic for CRUD operations
2. **MoodBoard/Sources/Views/CRUDListView.swift** - Main list view with @Query
3. **MoodBoard/Sources/Views/AddMoodSheetView.swift** - Sheet for adding/editing moods
4. **MoodBoard/Sources/Views/CRUDMoodRowView.swift** - Reusable row component
5. **Docs/04-ListCRUD.md** - CRUD patterns documentation
6. **MoodBoard/Sources/Views/FeaturesListView.swift** - Add Feature 04 navigation

# üìú TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

## CRUDViewModel.swift

**Purpose:** Centralize all business logic for CRUD operations

**Requirements:**
- Use `@Observable` for modern state management
- Inject `ModelContext` for SwiftData operations
- Implement all CRUD methods:
  - `addMood()` - Create new mood with validation
  - `startEditing()` / `saveEdit()` - Update existing mood
  - `deleteMood()` - Delete single mood
  - `deleteMoods(at:from:)` - Batch delete with IndexSet
  - `clearAllMoods()` - Delete all moods
- Form state management: `selectedEmoji`, `moodLabel`, `editingMood`
- Computed properties: `isFormValid`, `isEditing`, `submitButtonTitle`
- Error handling with try-catch and conditional compilation

**Pedagogical comments:**
- Explain MVVM separation of concerns
- Compare with Android ViewModel + Repository
- Compare with React custom hooks
- Explain why business logic should NOT be in Views

## CRUDListView.swift

**Purpose:** Main view displaying list of moods with @Query

**Requirements:**
- Use `@Query(sort: \Mood.timestamp, order: .reverse)` for reactive data
- Initialize ViewModel in `.task` lifecycle with ModelContext
- Display empty state with `ContentUnavailableView`
- List with sections, header, and instructional footer
- Toolbar with Add (+) and Clear All buttons
- Sheet presentation for add/edit
- Swipe actions:
  - Swipe right: Edit (blue)
  - Swipe left: Delete (red)
- Tap gesture on row to open edit sheet

**Pedagogical comments:**
- Explain @Query reactivity
- Compare with Room's @Query in Android
- Explain MVVM in practice (View delegates to ViewModel)
- Explain sheet presentation and dismissal

## AddMoodSheetView.swift

**Purpose:** Modal form for adding or editing moods

**Requirements:**
- Context-aware: Same sheet for add and edit (determined by ViewModel)
- Emoji picker in LazyVGrid with visual selection state
- Text field for mood label
- Form validation: Disable submit button until valid
- Toolbar with Cancel and Submit buttons
- Adaptive title: "Add Mood" vs "Edit Mood"
- Presentation detents: `.medium` and `.large`
- On dismiss: cancel pending edit

**Pedagogical comments:**
- Explain modal presentations
- Explain context-aware UI
- Compare with Android DialogFragment
- Explain form validation patterns

## CRUDMoodRowView.swift

**Purpose:** Reusable component for displaying a mood row

**Requirements:**
- Display emoji in circular background
- Show mood label (headline) and timestamp (relative)
- Chevron indicator for edit affordance
- Full accessibility support (labels, hints, values)
- Support light and dark mode

**Pedagogical comments:**
- Explain component reusability
- Compare with Android ViewHolder
- Compare with React functional components
- Explain accessibility best practices

# üé® CONVENTIONS

- Target: iOS 17+
- Language: Swift 6
- Framework: SwiftUI
- No external dependencies
- Code: minimal, readable, commented (in English)

# üß≠ NAVIGATION INTEGRATION

Added to `FeaturesListView.swift`:

```swift
// Feature 04: List CRUD
Section {
    NavigationLink {
        CRUDListView()
    } label: {
        FeatureRowView(
            number: "04",
            title: "List CRUD",
            description: "Complete CRUD operations with SwiftData & MVVM",
            icon: "list.bullet.clipboard",
            color: .green
