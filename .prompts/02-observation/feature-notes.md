# Feature Notes ‚Äî 02: Observation

**Date**: 2025-10-19  
**Branch**: `feature/02-observation`

---

## üéØ Objective

Introduce modern state management using iOS 17+ `@Observable` and `@Bindable` macros to manage a mood tracking store, replacing the old `@ObservableObject` + `@Published` pattern.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables

### 1. Model Layer
- **MoodStore.swift** (Sources/Models/)
  - `Mood` struct: id, emoji, label, timestamp
  - `MoodStore` class with @Observable
  - Methods: addMood, removeMood, clearAll
  - Sample data factory

### 2. View Layer
- **MoodListView.swift** (Sources/Views/)
  - Main list view with @State store
  - Empty state with ContentUnavailableView
  - Swipe to delete
  - Add mood sheet with emoji grid
  - Custom MoodRowView component

### 3. Documentation
- **02-Observation.md** (Docs/)
  - @Observable vs @ObservableObject comparison
  - @Bindable explanation
  - Migration guide (old ‚Üí new)
  - Framework comparisons (React, Compose, Vue)
  - Best practices & anti-patterns

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Updated **FeaturesListView.swift**
  - Added Feature 02 in new "State Management" section
  - Purple brain icon
  - Links to MoodListView

### 5. Prompt Archives
- PROMPT.md (this directory)
- feature-notes.md (this file)
- metadata.json (output/)

## üîß Development Notes

### Technical Decisions

1. **@Observable over @ObservableObject**
   - Reason: Modern iOS 17+ API, better performance
   - Tradeoff: Requires iOS 17+ minimum deployment target

2. **@State for Store Ownership**
   - Reason: Simpler than @StateObject with @Observable
   - Pattern: @State for ownership, direct pass to children

3. **Class vs Struct for Store**
   - Reason: Need reference semantics for shared state
   - Pattern: @Observable only works with classes

4. **Grid Layout for Emoji Selection**
   - Reason: Better UX than list for visual selection
   - Implementation: LazyVGrid with adaptive columns

### Key Differences from Feature 01

| Aspect | Feature 01 (@State) | Feature 02 (@Observable) |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Scope | View-local state | Shared state across views |
| Type | Primitive types | Custom class |
| Persistence | Transient | Can be persistent |
| Complexity | Simple counter | Full CRUD operations |

### SwiftUI Concepts Introduced

- **@Observable macro**: Automatic property observation
- **@Bindable**: Two-way binding for @Observable
- **ContentUnavailableView**: Modern empty state (iOS 17+)
- **Sheet presentation**: Modal form for adding moods
- **List .onDelete**: Swipe to delete gesture
- **LazyVGrid**: Responsive grid layout
- **Form validation**: Disabled button logic

### Pedagogical Parallels

- **@Observable** ‚âà React Context API + useState
- **@Bindable** ‚âà React props with callbacks
- **MoodStore** ‚âà Jetpack Compose ViewModel
- **List + ForEach** ‚âà React .map() over array

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Ideas for extending this feature:

1. **Persistence**
   - Save moods with SwiftData
   - Or UserDefaults for simple storage

2. **Filtering & Sorting**
   - Filter by emoji type
   - Sort by date, label, emoji

3. **Statistics**
   - Mood frequency chart
   - Most common emoji
   - Mood trends over time

4. **Customization**
   - Custom emoji picker
   - Color themes per mood
   - Tags/categories

5. **Sharing**
   - Export mood history
   - Share mood summary
   - Calendar integration
