# Navigation Refactor — Development Notes

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Type:** Architecture Refactor  
**Triggered By:** Feature 05 navigation bugs

---

## 📝 Implementation Summary

Complete refactoring of navigation architecture from multiple nested `NavigationStack`s to a centralized Router pattern with a single root NavigationStack. This resolved all navigation bugs and established a scalable foundation for future features.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

### Symptoms
- Tapping moods in CRUDListView didn't navigate to detail view
- Sometimes returned to FeaturesListView instead
- Blank screens appeared intermittently
- Console errors: `Failed to create 1206x0 image slot (alpha=1 wide=1)`
- Back button behavior was unpredictable

### Root Cause
Multiple `NavigationStack`s were interfering with each other:

```
FeaturesListView (NavigationStack #1)
├─ NavigationLink → MoodListView (NavigationStack #2) ❌
├─ NavigationLink → CRUDListView
│  └─ .navigationDestination → MoodDetailView ❌ Conflict!
```

When CRUDListView tried to register `.navigationDestination(for: Mood.self)`, it conflicted with FeaturesListView's NavigationStack, causing navigation events to get lost or misdirected.

## 🎯 Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Centralized Router vs Coordinator Pattern

**Chosen:** Centralized Router with @Observable

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than full Coordinator pattern
- Sufficient for app's current complexity
- Leverages SwiftUI's NavigationStack naturally
- @Observable provides reactivity without boilerplate
- Easy for developers to understand

**Trade-offs:**
- Less separation than Coordinator
- But: Can refactor if app grows significantly
- But: Current approach is more SwiftUI-idiomatic

### Decision 2: Route.moodDetail(mood: Mood) vs ID-based

**Chosen:** Pass full Mood object in route

**Rationale:**
- Mood is Hashable (automatic via @Model)
- No serialization/deserialization overhead
- Type-safe: compiler ensures Mood exists
- Direct object access in destination
- Simpler code

**Trade-offs:**
- Larger memory footprint in navigation path
- But: iOS handles efficiently
- But: Can optimize later if needed

### Decision 3: Button vs Custom NavigationLink

**Chosen:** Button + router.navigate()

**Rationale:**
- Consistent pattern everywhere
- Easy to add logging/analytics layer
- Programmatic navigation available
- No "magic" NavigationLink behavior
- Easier to debug and test

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more verbose
- But: More explicit and predictable
- But: Better for maintainability

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: Environment Router Not Found

**Symptom:**
```
Fatal error: No @Environment key for Router
```

**Cause:** Forgot to inject router in ContentView

**Solution:**
```swift
NavigationStack(path: $router.path) {
    FeaturesListView()
}
.environment(router)  // ✨ Must inject
```

**Learning:** Always inject environment objects at the same level where they're created

### Issue 2: Destinations Not Resolving

**Symptom:** Tapping button did nothing, no navigation

**Cause:** Missing case in ContentView.destinationView()

**Solution:**
```swift
case .crudList:  // ✨ Must register every route
    CRUDListView()
```

**Learning:** Route enum and destination switch must stay in sync

### Issue 3: Compilation Errors After Removing NavigationStack

**Symptom:**
```
'navigationTitle' modifier can only be used within a NavigationStack
```

**Cause:** Removed NavigationStack but kept .navigationTitle modifier

**Solution:** Keep .navigationTitle modifier – it works with parent NavigationStack

**Learning:** .navigationTitle doesn't require local NavigationStack, works with ancestor

### Issue 4: AddMoodSheetView Blank Screen

**Symptom:** Sheet appeared blank after refactor

**Cause:** Accidentally removed NavigationStack from sheet

**Solution:** Sheets can (and should) have their own NavigationStack:
```swift
// ✅ Correct: Sheets are independent
NavigationStack {
    Form { ... }
}
```

**Learning:** Sheets are separate navigation hierarchies, keep their NavigationStacks

---

## ✨ Highlights

### Single Source of Truth

**Before:**
```swift
// 4 different places managing navigation
FeaturesListView → NavigationStack #1
MoodListView → NavigationStack #2
CRUDListView → .navigationDestination
AddMoodSheetView → NavigationStack #3 (OK)
```

**After:**
```swift
// 1 place managing navigation
ContentView → NavigationStack (all routes)
AddMoodSheetView → NavigationStack (modal exception)
```

### Type-Safe Routes

**Before:**
```swift
NavigationLink {
    MoodDetailView(mood: mood)
}
// No compile-time checking of navigation structure
```

**After:**
```swift
router.navigate(to: .moodDetail(mood: mood))
// Compiler enforces route registration
```

### Programmatic Navigation

**Before:**
```swift
// Only works with NavigationLink
// Hard to navigate from non-view code
```

**After:**
```swift
// Works from anywhere
@Environment(Router.self) var router
router.navigate(to: .moodDetail(mood: mood))

// Even from ViewModels (if passed router)
func handleDeepLink() {
    router.navigate(to: .someRoute)
}
```
